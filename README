NAME
    Class::XSAccessor::Compat - Class::Accessor::Fast compatible interface
    for Class::XSAccessor

SYNOPSIS
    Use it like you would use "Class::Accessor::Fast". But MUCH faster.

DESCRIPTION
    "Class::XSAccessor::Compat" implements a compatibility layer for
    Class::Accessor::Fast on top of Class::XSAccessor.

    It should work exactly the same way as "Class::Accessor::Fast".

SEE ALSO
    *   Class::XSAccessor

    *   Class::Accessor::Fast

    *   Class::Accessor::Fast::XS

        ... which is a fork of "Class::XSAccessor" and provides the same
        interface as this module. But it doesn't have the same maintenance
        and optimization level as "Class::XSAccessor" itself.

    *   Class::Accessor

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
    This module was inspired by and based on Ruslan Zakirov's
    "Class::Accessor::Fast::XS" module. That, in turn was heavily based on
    an old version of "Class::XSAccessor".
